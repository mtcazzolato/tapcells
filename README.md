# TAP Cells: Tracking and Predicting Cell positions

*Last Update: January 3, 2022.*  

***TAP Cells*** method was proposed for the tracking and prediction of cells of embryos depicted in sequences of microscopic images.  

TAP Cells's algorithms was proposed in the work [Cazzolato *et al.*, 2022], published in the Information Systems Journal:
